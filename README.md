# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

A modern, interactive web application that brings pathfinding algorithms to life.
Perfect for beginners, students, and anyone curious about how algorithms like **A***, **Dijkstra**, or **BFS** navigate through a grid — all **without requiring any programming knowledge**.

🌐 **Live Demo:**

## 📖 How to Use

### 🧱 Setting Up the Grid

* Click & drag to **add/remove walls**
* Drag the **green node** to set the start position
* Drag the **red node** to set the end position

### 🧠 Choosing an Algorithm

Select from:

* A* (Medium difficulty)
* Dijkstra (Easy)
* BFS (Easy)

### ▶️ Visualization Controls

* **Visualize** — starts the animation
* **Clear Path** — clears the previous result
* **Reset Grid** — wipes everything

### ⚙️ Customization

## 🔎 Understanding the Visualization

| Element          | Meaning                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| 🟩 Start Node    | Starting point            |
| 🟥 End Node      | Destination               |
| ⬛ Walls          | Impassable obstacles      |
| 🔵 Visited Nodes | Explored by the algorithm |
| 🟨 Shortest Path | Final optimal route       |

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

### ⭐ A* Search Algorithm

* **Difficulty:** Medium
* **Best For:** When you have directional hints to the target
* **Analogy:** Like GPS — considers both distance traveled and straight-line distance remaining

### 💧 Dijkstra's Algorithm

* **Difficulty:** Easy
* **Best For:** Guaranteed shortest paths in weighted graphs
* **Analogy:** Like water spreading — always reaches the nearest point first

### 🏢 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

* **Difficulty:** Easy
* **Best For:** Shortest path in **unweighted** grids
* **Analogy:** Like checking all rooms on a floor before going upstairs

## 📊 Real-Time Statistics

During visualization, the app displays:

* **Path Length** — nodes in the final path
* **Visited Nodes** — total explored
* **Time Taken** — execution time in ms
* **Current Algorithm**

---

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Built With

* **HTML5** — Structure
* **CSS3** — Styling (Grid, Flexbox)
* **JavaScript** — Pathfinding logic + interactivity
* **Font Awesome** — Icons
* **Google Fonts** — Modern typography
